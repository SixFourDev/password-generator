# Shane's Password Generator

## Description

My motivation on building this webpage was to use the skills we learned this week in class, and create a password generator using Javascript. The reason building this webpage was to allow users visit, and create a password for them using lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters with a password from 8 to 128 characters. A few things I've learned creating this webpage was utilizing arrays, creating window prompts for the user, using an object and passing it through a function, using concat to concatenate the passwordSpecs to generate the password, and inplementing math floor and math random to determine the length of the password to generate.

## Usage

This webpage was created to generate a random password between 8 and 128 characters with lowercase, uppercase, special, and number characters. To use this webpage, simply click the "Generate Password" button, the window will prompt you and ask how long you would like your password to be, then will ask if you would like lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers to your password. Then after user answers all prompts it will generate a random password with the length the user has chose and all the characters that was chosen as well.
